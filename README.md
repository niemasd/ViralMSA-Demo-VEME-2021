# ViralMSA Demo (VEME 2021)
In this demo, we will run [ViralMSA](https://github.com/niemasd/ViralMSA) on an example SARS-CoV-2 dataset.

## Step 1: Install ViralMSA and Minimap2
Before analyzing any data, you must first install ViralMSA and Minimap2:

* **ViralMSA:** https://github.com/niemasd/ViralMSA#installation
* **Minimap2:** https://github.com/lh3/minimap2#install

## Step 2: Download Unaligned SARS-CoV-2 Genome Sequence Dataset
We will be using a dataset of curated SARS-CoV-2 consensus sequences from [Kristian Andersen's lab](https://andersen-lab.com/). The original data repository can be found here:

https://github.com/andersen-lab/HCoV-19-Genomics

Rather than downloading the dataset from the Andersen lab's repository, however, we have merged the consensus sequences into a single file and have provided it in this repository, so you can just download the following file:
